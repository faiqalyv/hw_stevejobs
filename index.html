              Apple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak
              to build his own computer-a dream that was made suddenly feasible with
              the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer,
              the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented
              microprocessor chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer
              Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair, Wozniak
              quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer.
